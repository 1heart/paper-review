## VGGNet

Finally, we reach VGGNet, which is even today still commonly used as a feature extractor. Though it won second place in ILSVRC 2014 (to GoogLeNet and the Inception architecture), its demonstration of simplicity and its best single-model performance make it widely used. The paper, titled ["Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556/)[^vggnet], appeared in ICLR 2015 and was authored by Simonyan and Zisserman at Oxford (now at Google DeepMind).
